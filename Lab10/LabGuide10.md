## Part 0. Enable Data Safe for your Tenancy
- Oracle Data Safe administrators can enable Oracle Data Safe in a region of their tenancy. Be aware that it is not possible to disable Oracle Data Safe after it's enabled.
### Step 1: 
1. To enable Oracle Data Safe, you must belong to one of the following groups in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM):
2. Your tenancy's **Administrators group**. This group has permission on all resources in your tenancy.<!--<br/>--> 
**NOTE:** A group in your tenancy that has the **manage** permission for Oracle Data Safe and can **inspect** groups in the tenancy.<!--<br/>--> 
3. Grant a group all permissions in a tenancy
4. To grant the Data-Safe-Admins group all permissions on all resources in a tenancy, the policy might be:
	- Allow group Data-Safe-Admins to manage all-resources in tenancy <!-- Change this to add code in md-->
	- Allow group Data-Safe-Admins to inspect groups in tenancy
	- Make a group an Oracle Data Safe administrators group for the whole tenancy
5. To allow the Data-Safe-Admins group to enable and manage Oracle Data Safe in any region of a tenancy, the policy might be as follows. Note that the group cannot manage all resources in the tenancy with this permission.
Allow group Data-Safe-Admins to manage data-safe in tenancy
Allow group Data-Safe-Admins to inspect groups in tenancy
Make a group an Oracle Data Safe administrators group for a particular region in a tenancy
6. To allow a Data-Safe-Admins group to enable and manage Oracle Data Safe only in the us-phoenix-1 region of a tenancy, include a where clause in your policy statement:
	- Allow group Data-Safe-Admins to manage data-safe in tenancy where request.region='phx'
	- Allow group Data-Safe-Admins to inspect groups in tenancy

For more information please see [Data Safe Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/data-safe/udscs/enable-oracle-data-safe.html#GUID-409260CE-2D7B-4029-B7CA-2EDD6E961CEB)

### Step 2: 
- Both native and federated users in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure can enable Oracle Data Safe.
1. Ensure that you have the required permissions for enabling Oracle Data Safe.
2. Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console. <!-- Add login images-->
3. At the top of the page, select the region in which you want to enable Oracle Data Safe.
4. From the navigation menu, select **Data Safe**.
5. Click **Enable Data Safe**.
6. Collapse


## Part 1. Registering a Target Database

### Step  1:

- You can register an Autonomous Database from its Console in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console. From this Console, you can also access the Oracle Data Safe Console.

1. Sign in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.<!-- Add login console images if skipping lab 0-->
![](./images/1.1.png " ")
2. In the upper right corner, select the region in which your Autonomous Database resides.
3. From the navigation menu, select **Autonomous Data Warehouse** or **Autonomous Transaction Processing**.
![](./images/1.2.png " ")
4. From the **COMPARTMENT** drop-down list, select the compartment that contains your Autonomous Database.
![](./images/1.3.png " ")
5. Click the name of your Autonomous Database. The **Autonomous Database Information** tab on the **Autonomous Database Details** page is displayed.
6. Under **Data Safe**, click **Register**.
7. A Confirm dialog box asks if you are sure you want to register the database with Oracle Data Safe.
8. Click **Confirm**. Wait for registration to finish.
9. When registration is completed, the **Status** reads **Registered**. A resource group is created in Oracle Data Safe with the same name as the compartment that contains the database in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. The user registering the database is automatically authorized to manage the User Assessment, Security Assessment, and Activity Auditing features for that resource group.
10. (Optional) Click **View Console** to navigate to the Oracle Data Safe Console for the database.
![](./images/1.4.png " ")


### Step 2:
- The roles that you grant to this account determine the Oracle Data Safe features that you can use with your Autonomous Database. These particular roles allow you to assess users and security configurations on your Autonomous Database and start audit trail collection immediately after you register the database.

- The following table describes the available roles for Autonomous Databases [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/data-safe/udscs/register-autonomous-databases-that-have-public-ip-addresses.html#GUID-1026A408-2D57-420C-927B-588948C2A89C).

![](./images/1.01.png "")<!--<br/>--> 
![](./images/1.25.png "")
**NOTE**:You can grant or revoke roles as often as needed.
1. Using a tool like SQL Developer, log in to your Autonomous Database as the Admin user (ADMIN).
![](./images/1.22.png "")
2. Grant or revoke a role from the Oracle Data Safe service account by running one of the following commands:
	`EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.GRANT_ROLE('role_name');`
	or
	`EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.REVOKE_ROLE('role_name');`
	 - where role_name is the name of an Oracle Data Safe role. role_name must be in quotation marks.
- These are the roles you can add now to your SQL Developer worksheet.<!--<br/>--> 
`EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.GRANT_ROLE('DS$ASSESSMENT_ROLE');`<!--<br/>--> 
`EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.GRANT_ROLE('DS$AUDIT_COLLECTION_ROLE');`<!--<br/>--> 
`EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.GRANT_ROLE('DS$DATA_MASKING_ROLE');`<!--<br/>--> 
`EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.GRANT_ROLE('DS$AUDIT_SETTING_ROLE');`<!--<br/>--> 
`EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.GRANT_ROLE('DS$DATA_DISCOVERY_ROLE');`<!--<br/>-->

1. In the Oracle Data Safe Console (refer to Part 1 step 2 on how to log in), generate a Comprehensive Assessment report
2. Navigate to the Oracle Data Safe Console
3. Click the **Home** tab and then **Security Assessment**.
<!-- Image 1-->
![](./images/2.1.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
4. On the **Security Assessment** page, select the check box for your target database, and click **Assess**.
<!-- Image 2-->
![](./images/2.1.2.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
5. Wait a moment for the report to generate.<!--<br/>-->
6. When the report is generated, review the high risk, medium risk, and low risk values.<!--<br/>-->
7. In the **Last Generated Report** column, click **View Report**.<!--<br/>-->
<!-- Image 3-->
![](./images/2.1.3.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
8. The **Comprehensive Assessment** report is displayed on the **Reports** tab.<!--<br/>--> 
9. In the upper right corner, view the target name, when the database was assessed, and the database version.
<!-- Image 4-->
![](./images/2.1.4.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
10. At the top of the report, click either **Medium Risk, Low Risk, High Risk, or Advisory** to filter the report to show only their individual findings. These values give you an idea of how secure your database is.
<!-- Image 5-->
![](./images/2.1.5.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
![](./images/2.1.6.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
![](./images/2.1.7.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
![](./images/2.1.8.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
11.	View the values for security controls, user security, and security configurations. These totals show you the number of findings for each high-level category.<!--<br/>-->
12.	Browse the report by scrolling down and expanding and collapsing categories. Each category lists related findings about your database and how you can make changes to improve its security.<!--<br/>-->
13.	View the **Summary** table. This table compares the number of findings for each category and counts the number of findings per risk level. It helps you to identify the areas that need attention on your database.<!--<br/>-->
<!-- Image 6-->
![](./images/2.1.9.png " ")<!--<br/>-->


### Step 2: 
1.	At the top of the report, click **Evaluate** to filter the report to show only the Evaluate findings.

2.	Focus on **System Privilege Grants** under Privileges and Roles.<!--br/-->
3.	System privileges (**ALTER USER, CREATE USER, DROP USER**) can be used to create and modify other user accounts, including the ability to change passwords. 		This ability can be abused to gain access to another user's account, which may have greater privileges. **The Privilege Analysis feature may be helpful 	to determine whether or not a user or role has used account management privileges.**<!--br/-->
<!-- Image 8-->
![](./images/2.2.2.png " ")<!--<br/>-->


## Part 3. Assess Users with Oracle Data Safe
- Using Oracle Data Safe, assess user security in your target database by using the User Assessment feature and fix issues.

### Step 1:
1. In the Oracle Data Safe Console, click the **Home** tab, and then click **User Assessment**. The User Assessment page is displayed.
<!-- Image 3.1-->
![](./images/3.1.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->

![](./images/3.3.2.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
2. In the **Audit Records** column, click **View Activity** for the following users to view the audit records that they generated. Filters are automatically applied to **Operation Time** and **User Name**. Click Back to **User Assessment** report to return to the **User Assessment** report.
<!-- Image 3.7-->
![](./images/3.3.3.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
![](./images/3.3.4.png " ")<!--<br/>-->

- **NOTE:** DBA_DEBRA: Notice that DBA_DEBRA has the Audit Admin role, but has not generated any audit records.
3. In the table, click DBA_DEBRA. The **User Details** dialog box is displayed. Here you see she is not using her audit admin role, it may be recommended to reconsider her admin role.
<!--Image-->
![](./images/3.3.5.png " ")<!--<br/>-->

4.	On the right, expand the roles to view the privileges. 
5.	On the left, click the question mark next to **Risk**. Here you can review the factors that designate a user as Critical, High, Medium, or Low risk.<!--br/-->

## Part 4. Discover Sensitive Data with Oracle Data Safe

### Step 1: 
1. Navigate to the Oracle Data Safe Service Console
2. To access the **Data Discovery** wizard, click the **Home** tab, and then click **Data Discovery**.
<!-- Image 4.1-->
![](./images/4.1.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->

3. On the Select Target for Sensitive Data Discovery page, your target database is listed.<!--<br/>-->
**NOTE** Often, you want to perform data discovery against a production database where you can get an accurate and up-to-date picture of your sensitive data. You can discover sensitive data in the source database (a production or copy) and mask the cloned copies of this source database. Or, you can simply run a data discovery job on the actual database that you want to mask.<!--<br/>-->
4. Select your target database, and then click **Continue at the bottom right**.
<!-- Image 4.2-->
![](./images/4.1.2.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
5. On this page, you can create a new **sensitive data model**, select an existing one from the Library, or import a file-based sensitive data model.
<!-- Image 4.3-->
![](./images/4.1.3.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
 	 i. Leave **Create** selected.<!--<br/>-->
   	 ii. Name the sensitive data model as **SDM1**.<!--<br/>-->
   	 iii. Enable **Show and save sample data** so that Data Discovery retrieves sample data for each sensitive column, if it's available.<!--<br/>-->
    	 iv. Select your resource group. <!--<br/>-->
    	 v. Click **Continue**.<!--<br/>-->
6. On the **Select Schemas for Sensitive Data Discovery** page, select the schema that you want Data Discovery to search. In this case, select the **HCM1** schema, and click **Continue**.<!--<br/>-->
<!-- Image 4.4-->
![](./images/4.1.4.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
7. On the **Select Sensitive Types for Sensitive Data Discovery** page, select the **Select All** check box. <!--<br/>-->
**NOTE** Data Discovery categorizes its sensitive types as Identification Information, Biographic Information, IT Information, Financial Information, Healthcare Information, Employment Information, and Academic Information. Do the following:<!--<br/>-->
8. Select **Expand all** at the top. Notice that you can select individual sensitive types, sensitive categories, and all sensitive types.Scroll and review the sensitive types available.<!--<br/>-->
<!-- Image 4.5-->
![](./images/4.1.5.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
9. At the bottom of the page, select the **Non-Dictionary Relationship Discovery** check box.
**NOTE** Oracle Data Safe automatically discovers referential relationships defined in the data dictionary. The **Non-Dictionary Relationship Discovery** feature helps to identify application-level parent-child relationships that are not defined in the data dictionary. It helps discover application-level relationships so that data integrity is maintained during data masking.<!--<br/>-->
10.	When you are ready to start the data discovery job, click **Continue**.<!--<br/>-->
<!-- Image 4.6-->
11. The job will take a few minutes to complete. If the job is successful, the **Detail** column states Data discovery job finished successfully, and you can click **Continue**. Otherwise, you need to click **Back** or **Exit** and investigate the issue.

### Step 2:
- On the **Non-Dictionary Referential Relationships** page, you are presented with a list of potential non-dictionary (application level) referential relationships that Data Discovery found by using column name patterns and column data patterns. Do the following:
1. To view all of the columns, move the **Expand All** slider to the right. Data Discovery found some potentially sensitive columns (non-dictionary referential relationships) in the **PU_PETE schema**.<!--<br/>-->
<!-- Image 4.7-->
![](./images/4.2.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
2. Click **Save and Continue**.<!--<br/>-->
3. The **Sensitive Data Discovery Result** page is displayed. On this page, you can view and manage the sensitive columns in your sensitive data model. Your sensitive data model is **saved to the Library.**<!--<br/>-->
<!-- Image 4.8-->
![](./images/4.2.2.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
4. Notice that Data Discovery found sensitive columns in all three sensitive categories that you selected. To view the sensitive columns, move the **Expand All** slider to the right. The list includes the following:<!--<br/>-->
    -	Sensitive columns discovered based on the sensitive types that you selected<!--<br/>-->
    -	Dictionary-based referential relationships<!--<br/>-->
    -	Non-dictionary referential relationships<!--<br/>-->
5. Take a look at how the sensitive columns are organized. Initially, they are grouped by sensitive categories and sensitive types. To list the sensitive columns by schema and table, select **Schema View** from the drop-down list next to the **Expand All Slider**. **Schema View** is useful for quickly finding a sensitive *column* in a table and for viewing the list of sensitive columns in a table. For example, in the EMPLOYEES table there are several sensitive columns listed.<!--<br/>-->
**NOTE** If needed, you can add and remove sensitive columns from your sensitive data model by deselecting or selecting the box. You can use the **Add** button to add more sensitive columns.<!--<br/>-->
<!--Image-->
![](./images/4.2.3.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
**NOTE** Notice that some of the sensitive columns do not have a check box. These are dependent columns and they have a relationship with their parent column. For example, in the EMPLOYEES table, JOB_ID is listed. It has a relationship defined in the Oracle data dictionary to the JOBS.JOB_ID sensitive column. If you remove a sensitive column that has a referential relationship, both the sensitive column and referential relationship are removed from the sensitive data model. Therefore, if you deselect JOBS.JOB_ID, then EMPLOYEES.JOB_ID is removed too.<!--<br/>-->

6. View the sample data for the HCM1.SUPPLEMENTAL_DATA.LAST_INS_CLAIM column (expand HCM1 at the top, then expand supplemental data, then expand last_ins_claim). The sensitive type is **Healthcare Provider** and the discovered sensitive column is LAST_INS_CLAIM, which has values such as Cavity and Hair Loss. Your value may be different. This column isn't a Healthcare Provider type of column and thus it is a false positive; you can deselect this column. Being able to remove a sensitive column is important when your sensitive data model includes false positives. To be able to recognize false positives, it helps to know your data well.<!--<br/>-->
<!--**think if images should go here**-->
![](./images/4.2.4.png " ")<!--<br/>-->

### Step 3:
- Suppose that you're missing some sensitive columns in your sensitive data model. While working in the Data Discovery wizard, you can backtrack to reconfigure and rerun the data discovery job. You can repeat the process as many times as you need until you feel that your sensitive data model is accurate. Try the following:

1. Click **Back** 
2. Now you are on the **Select Sensitive Types for Sensitive Data Discovery** page. Here you can change your sensitive type selections and choose whether to include non-dictionary referential relationships in the search.
3. Select all of the sensitive categories.
4. Deselect **Non-Dictionary Relationship Discovery** at the bottom of the page.
<!-- Image 4.10-->
![](./images/4.3.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
5. To rerun the data discovery job, click **Continue**.<!--<br/>-->
6. When the job is finished, click **Continue**. Because you chose to not discover non-dictionary referential relationships, the wizard takes you directly to the **Sensitive Data Discovery Result** page.<!--<br/>-->
7. Expand all of the sensitive columns and review the results then scroll down and click reports.<!--<br/>-->
<!-- Image 4.11-->
![](./images/4.3.2.png " ")<!--<br/>-->

**NOTE** The report shows you a chart that compares sensitive categories. You can also view totals of sensitive values, sensitive types, sensitive tables, and sensitive columns. The table at the bottom of the report displays individual sensitive column names, sample data for the sensitive columns, column counts based on sensitive categories, and estimated data counts.<!--<br/>-->
<!-- Image 4.12-->
![](./images/4.4.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->

### Step 4: 
1. Click the **Library**  tab and click **Data Discovery.** and go to **Sensitive Data Models**.
2. For each sensitive data model, you can view information about when your sensitive data model was created, when it was last updated, and who owns it.
- If you need to remove your sensitive data model from the Library, you can select the check box for it, and click **Delete**. 
<!-- Image 4.17-->
![](./images/4.5.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
3. 	You can also **Download** the Sensitive Data Model. Open the file, and review the XML code. (Save the file to your desktop as **SDM1.xml**).
![](./images/4.6.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->

## Part 5. Verify Sensitive Data Model with Oracle Data Safe
- Using Oracle Data Safe, verify a sensitive data model by using the verification option in the Library and by using the Data Discovery wizard.

### Step 1: 
1. Open SQL Developer
2. On the SQL Worksheet, run the following command to add an AGE column to the EMPLOYEES table.
	`ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEES` 
 	`ADD AGE NUMBER;` <!-- Need to update this as a code snippet-->
3. Click the **Refresh** button to view the newly added column.
<!--image--> 
![](./images/5.1.1.png " ")

### Step 2: 
1. Navigate to the Oracle Data Safe Service Console
2. In the Oracle Data Safe Console, click the **Library** tab, and then click **Sensitive Data Models**.
![](./images/5.2.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
3. Select the check box for your sensitive data model that you created in Discovery Lab 1 - Discover Sensitive Data with Oracle Data Safe (**SDM1**).
4. Click **Verify Against Target**.
<!-- Image-->
![](./images/5.2.2.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
5. On the **Select Target for Data Model Verification** page, select your target database, and click **Continue**. The verification job is started. Once finished, click **Continue**.
<!-- Image-->
![](./images/5.2.3.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
![](./images/5.2.4.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
6. On the **Data Model Verification Result** page, notice that there are no differences to report. The verification job did not find the new sensitive column, AGE. Click **Continue**.<!--<br/>-->
**NOTE** The verification feature checks whether the sensitive columns in the sensitive data model are present in the target database. If there are some present in the sensitive data model, but missing in the target database, it reports them. In addition, it reports new referential relationships for the columns already present in the sensitive data model. It does not, however, discover ALL the relationships.

### Step 3: 
1. On the **Sensitive Data Model: SDM1** page, click **Add**. The **Add Sensitive Columns** dialog box is displayed.
<!-- Image-->
![](./images/5.3.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
![](./images/5.3.2.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
2. Expand the **HCM1**, and then the **EMPLOYEES** table, then select the **AGE** column. 
<!-- Image-->
![](./images/5.3.3.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
3. At the top of the dialog box in the **Sensitive Type** field, enter **age**. AGE is automatically retrieved as a sensitive type and you can select it.
<!-- Image-->
![](./images/5.3.4.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
4. Scroll to the bottom and click **Add to Result**. Your sensitive data model is updated to include the AGE column.<!--br/-->
5. To verify, enter age in the search box. HCM1.EMPLOYEES.AGE should be listed under **Biographic Information**.<!--br/-->
<!-- Image-->
![](./images/5.3.5.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
6. Click **Save and Continue** and then **Exit**.

### Step 4: 
1. Return to SQL Developer.
2. On the SQL Worksheet, run the following commands to drop the HCM1.EMPLOYEES.AGE column.
	`ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEES`
	 `DROP COLUMN AGE;` <!--<br/>-->
	<!--Image-->
	![](./images/5.4.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
3. To verify that the EMPLOYEES table no longer has an AGE column, run the following script:
	`SELECT AGE FROM HCM1.EMPLOYEES;` <!-- Need to update this as a code snippet-->
4. Notice that the AGE column is gone and you receive an "Invalid Identifier" message when you run the command.
<!--Image-->
![](./images/5.4.2.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
5. If the AGE column is still there, click the **Refresh** button to refresh the table. 

### Step 5: 
<!-- optional-->
1. Return to Oracle Data Safe.
2. Click the **Home** tab, and then click **Data Discovery**.
<!-- Image--> 
![](./images/5.5.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
3. On the **Select Target for Sensitive Data Discovery** page, select your target database, and then click **Continue**.<!--<br/>-->

![](./images/5.5.4.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
5.. Select your sensitive data model, **SDM1**.<!--<br/>-->
6.. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and select **Verify if SDM is compatible with the target.**<!--<br/>-->
<!-- Image--> 
![](./images/5.5.5.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
8. To start the verification job, click Continue. If the job finishes successfully, click **Continue**. The **Data Model Verification Result** page is displayed.<!--<br/>-->
9. Expand **Missing sensitive columns**, and then HCM1. The Data Discovery wizard identifies the AGE column as missing from the database.<!--<br/>-->
<!-- Image--> 
![](./images/5.5.7.png " ")<!--<br/>-->

### Step 6: 
- You can manually update your sensitive data model while continuing to work in the Data Discovery wizard. In which case, you simply deselect your sensitive column and save your sensitive data model. This part, however, shows you another way to do it from the Library.

1. Click **Exit** to exit the Data Discovery wizard.
2. Click the **Library** tab, and then click **Sensitive Data Models**.
3. Click your sensitive data model to open it.
4. Search for **AGE**.
<!-- Image-->
5. In the list of sensitive columns, deselect HCM1.EMPLOYEES.AGE.
![](./images/5.6.1.png " ")
6. Your sensitive data model is now updated and accurate.
7. Click **Save** then **Exit**.

## Part 6. Update a Sensitive Data Model with Oracle Data Safe
- Using Oracle Data Safe, perform an incremental update to a sensitive data model by using the Data Discovery wizard.

### Step 1: 
1. Open SQL Developer
2. On the SQL Worksheet, run the following commands to add an AGE column to the EMPLOYEES table.
	`ALTER TABLE HCM1.EMPLOYEES ADD AGE NUMBER;`
<!-- Need to update this as a code snippet-->

## Part 7. Create a Sensitive Type and Sensitive Category with Oracle Data Safe

### Step 1: 

1. In the Oracle Data Safe Console, click the **Library** tab, and then click **Sensitive Types**. On this page you can view predefined sensitive types and manage your own sensitive types.
<!-- Image--> 
![](./images/7.1.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
2. Scroll through the list and become familiar with the different sensitive types available. The list contains predefined sensitive types only.
<!-- Image--> 
![](./images/7.1.2.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
3. Move the **Hide Oracle Predefined** slider to the right. The list removes the Oracle defined sensitive types, showing only the ones that you have defined. Move the slider back to the left.
<!-- Image--> 
![](./images/7.1.3.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
4. To view the definition for a sensitive type, click directly on any one of the sensitive types. The **Sensitive Type Details** dialog box is displayed.
<!-- Image--> 
![](./images/7.1.5.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
	**NOTE:** Here you can view the sensitive type's short name, description, column name pattern (regular expression), column comment pattern (regular 		expression), column data pattern (regular expression), the search pattern semantic (And or Or), the default masking format associated with the sensitive 	type, and the sensitive category and resource group to which the sensitive type belongs.<!--<br/>-->
5. Click **Close** to close the dialog box.<!--<br/>-->
6. To check if there is a sensitive type that discovers department IDs, in the search field, enter **Department**. The search finds **Department Name**, but nothing for department IDs.<!--<br/>-->
<!-- Image--> 
![](./images/7.1.6.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
7. Clear the search field, and then press **Enter** to restore the list.<!--<br/>-->
8. Keep this page open because you return to it later in the lab.<!--<br/>-->

### **Step 2:** 
1. Open SQL Developer
2. Run the following script:
`SELECT * FROM HCM1.DEPARTMENTS;` <!-- Need to update this to code snippet md-->
3. Notice that the department ID values are 10, 20, 30, up to 270.
<!-- Image--> 
![](./images/7.2.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->


### **Step 3:** 
1. Return to the **Sensitive Types** page in the Oracle Data Safe Console. Click **Add**<!--<br/>-->
 The **Create Sensitive Type** dialog box is displayed. - From the **Create Like** drop-down list, select **Employee ID Number**. <!--<br/>-->
    **NOTE:** It will autofill to a different Sensitive Type, so adjust accordingly.
	<!-- Image--> 
	![](./images/7.3.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
	1. In the **Sensitive Type Name** field, enter **Custom Department ID Number**.
	2. In the **Sensitive Type Short Name** field, enter **Custom Dept ID**.
	**Tip**: It is helpful to use a word like "Custom" when naming your own sensitive types to make them easier to search for and identify.
	3. In the **Sensitive Type Description** field, enter  "Identification number assigned to departments. Examples: 10, 20, 30â€¦1000."
	4. In the **Column Name Pattern** field, enter:
	`(^|[_-])(DEPT?|DEPARTMENT).?(ID|NO$|NUM|NBR)`<!-- Need to update this to code snippet md-->
	5. In the **Column Comment Pattern** field, enter:
	`(DEPT?|DEPARTMENT).?(ID|NO |NUM|NBR)`<!-- Need to update this to code snippet md-->
	6. In the **Column Data Pattern** field, enter:
	`^[0-9]{2,4}$`<!-- Need to update this to code snippet md-->
	7. For **Search Pattern Semantic**, select **And**.
	8. In the **Default Masking Format** field, enter **Identification Number**.
	9. In the **Sensitive Category** field, enter **Sensitive Category**. If you do not specify a sensitive category, the category is automatically named 		"Uncategorized."
	10. Select your resource group.
	11. Click **Save**.
2. Your sensitive type is now included in the list and is available in the Data Discovery wizard.
	<!-- Image--> 
	![](./images/7.3.2.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
3. Move the **Hide Oracle Predefined** slider to the right to view your custom sensitive type in the list.
**All Done!**

## Part 8. Mask Sensitive Data with Oracle Data Safe

### Step 1:
1. Open SQL Developer and login as **HCM1** user.
2. Run the following script:
`SELECT * FROM SUPPLEMENTAL_DATA;`
3. Notice that you are seeing Payment Account Number, this sensitive data was discovered in **Data Discovery**. View the Account number for TAXPAYER_ID 173-14-3494.<!--<br/>-->
![](./images/8.1.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->

### Step 2: 
1. Open up Data Safe Console, click **HOME** then click **Data Discovery**.<!--<br/>-->
![](./images/8.2.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
2. Select Target and click **Continue**
![](./images/8.2.2.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
3. Data Discovery is required to be done before Data Masking. Select **Pick from Library** and click **Continue**.<!--<br/>-->
![](./images/8.2.4.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
4. Select **SDM1**, keep **Update the SDM with the target** as selected and click **Continue**.
![](./images/8.2.5.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
5. Click **Continue** after sensitive data discovery is complete. 
![](./images/8.2.6.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
6. Click **Report**
![](./images/8.2.7.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
7. Click **Continue to mask the data**
![](./images/8.2.8.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
8. Select a target for Data Masking and click **Continue**
9. Click **Select All** to deselect all columns. Only select **Financial Information** as the Payment Account Number falls under that category. Click **Confirm Policy**.<!--<br/>-->
![](./images/8.2.9.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
10. Schedule the Masking Job for **Right Now** and click **Review**.<!--<br/>-->
![](./images/8.2.10.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
**NOTE** Make sure this is not done on a production database. <!--<br/>-->
11. Click **Submit** and wait for the masking job to be finished.<!--<br/>-->
![](./images/8.2.11.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
12. Click **Report** to view your successful Masking Job.<!--<br/>-->
13. Click **Expand All** to see all the values that have been masked. 
![](./images/8.2.12.png " ")<!--<br/>-->

**NOTE:** Run the following script in SQL developer if you face an error saying "Oracle Data Safe service account on your Autonomous Database does not have sufficient privileges. Grant DS$DATA_MASKING_ROLE by running the GRANT_ROLE procedure in DS_TARGET_UTIL PL/SQL package" `EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.GRANT_ROLE('DS$DATA_MASKING_ROLE');`<!--<br/>--> 

### Step 3: 
1. Open SQL Developer
2. Run the following script:
`SELECT * FROM SUPPLEMENTAL_DATA;`
![](./images/8.3.1.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
3. Notice that the **Payment Account Number** has been changed to a randomized credit card number for the TAXPAYER_ID 173-14-3494. <!--<br/>-->
4. Click **Library** and select **Masking Formats** and view the different masking formats.<!--<br/>-->
![](./images/8.3.2.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
5. View **Credit Card Number** and **Credit Card Number (Hyphenated)** by clicking on them.<!--<br/>-->
![](./images/8.3.3.png " ")<!--<br/>-->
**NOTE** By default Data Safe selected Credit Card Number and replaced the value by that masking format. This masking can be done once more to select **Credit Card Number (Hyphenated)** to follow the same format as the previous Credit Card value. 
![](./images/8.3.4.png " ")<!--<br/>-->

**All Done!**
Congratulations! You have just completed the Oracle Data Safe Lab.
